# PwC-s-Switzerland-Virtual-Job-Simulation
A few days ago, I completed the PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Experience job simulation, facilitated by Forage, offering invaluable insights into data analysis and Power BI utilization typical for PwC interns. 
Throughout the simulation, I delved into three distinct datasets, including Call Centre Trends, Customer Retention, and Diversity & Inclusion. 
Leveraging Power BI, I crafted reports and dashboards, employing various DAX functions for data cleansing, creating measures, and calculating columns, enhancing my proficiency in these essential analytical skills.
This virtual experience, in particular, was provided by Forage and is completely free.
