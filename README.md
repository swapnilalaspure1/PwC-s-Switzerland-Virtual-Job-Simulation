# PwC-s-Switzerland-Virtual-Job-Simulation
Recently, I completed PwC Switzerland's Power BI Virtual Experience job simulation, a fantastic opportunity offered by Forage at no cost. Through this immersive program, I delved into real-world scenarios interns at PwC tackle in data analysis and Power BI. 
Across tasks such as visualizing call center trends, exploring customer retention, and examining diversity and inclusion metrics, I honed my skills in data visualization, dashboard creation, and DAX functions. This experience provided invaluable insight into the practical applications of data analysis in a professional setting.

Task One: Analyzed call center trends, crafting a Power BI dashboard showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Utilized various resources for data visualization enhancement.

Task Two: Explored customer retention through demographic insights, constructing a concise dashboard with defined KPIs. Presented findings and recommendations via email to the engagement partner.

Task Three: Investigated gender balance in executive positions, leveraging HR data to visualize gender-related KPIs.
